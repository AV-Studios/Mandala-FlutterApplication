Mandala: The Mind Circle is the mental health society of SRM University, Delhi NCR. This society focuses on the mental well being of every student in the university and extends help to anyone who is dealing with a psychological crisis.  
  
We want to make sure that nobody in the university is going through mental issues or traumas, and thus we wish to provide relief and a safe space where you can discuss such issues.
